# 🛍️ Customer Behavior Data Analysis

This project explores **customer shopping behavior** using data analysis techniques in Python and SQL.  
The goal is to uncover patterns in customer demographics, spending habits, and product preferences to help businesses make data-driven decisions.

## 📊 Project Overview

The dataset contains information about:
- Customer details (age, gender, location)
- Purchase history and frequency
- Product categories
- Discounts and spending patterns
- Review ratings

Using this data, we performed a detailed analysis to answer key business questions such as:
- Which customer group contributes most to total revenue?
- How do discounts affect purchase amounts?
- What are the top-rated product categories?
- Which customer segments show high loyalty?

## 🧠 Key Insights
1. **Male vs Female Revenue Comparison** – identified which gender generates more revenue.  
2. **Discount Effect** – found customers who used discounts but still spent above the average.  
3. **Top 5 Products** – discovered products with the highest average review rating.  
4. **Purchase Frequency** – analyzed how frequently customers make purchases.  
5. **Revenue Distribution** – segmented customers based on age and spending behavior.  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python** – Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **SQL (PostgreSQL)** – for querying and analyzing structured data  
- **Jupyter Notebook / VS Code** – for experimentation and visualization  
- **Excel / CSV** – for data storage and review
- **Power BI** - Data Vizualisation

## 📈 Business Recommendations
- Focus marketing on **high-spending age groups**.
- Use **targeted discounts** — avoid over-discounting for already loyal customers.
- Promote **top-rated products** with higher visibility.
- Encourage **repeat purchases** through loyalty programs.
- Improve **product reviews** with follow-up engagement.
